I recently built my first pc. The build went great, and everything seems to be running fantastic. I'm a bit concerned about a program called Daemon Tools Lite however that I installed from an Asus support cd that came with my motherboard (might have been with my gpu, but both are Asus brand anyways). I didn't really know what it was, but decided to check it out, it came from Asus with my product so why not. After opening the program once, immediately closing it, and google searching Daemon Tools. daemon tools –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏—Ç –≤–∞–º —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å –¥–æ 4-—Ö –≤–∏—Ä—Ç—É–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö cd –∏–ª–∏ dvd –ø—Ä–∏–≤–æ–¥–æ–≤, –∏ –≤—ã —Å–º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–º–æ–µ –≤–∞—à–∏—Ö –∑–∞—â–∏—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –æ—Ç –∫–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è cd/dvd –±–µ–∑. I recently installed Daemon Tools Lite 10.7, but it seems to have broken a few other programs on my PC for some unknown reason and thus I have tried uninstalling it. Unfortunately, any attempts to remove it end in failure or crashes. Regular uninstallation causes a BSOD. I've gone through the process list to remove anything related to Daemon Tools when doing this, but it has not helped. A google search on this topic suggested that the installation may have broken a driver, and running Driver.
